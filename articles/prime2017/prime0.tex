\noindent\textbf{Schedule.} Thursday and Friday, 3:30 PM to 5:30 PM at the math lab.

\noindent\phantom{.}\\\textbf{Homework.} There will be 6 problem sets, due on Wednesdays except the final problem set. These will refer to last year's PRIME problems, which can be found in \url{http://www.cjquines.com/files/prime.pdf}. All problem sets must be submitted completely. The lowest scoring set will be dropped.

\noindent\phantom{.}\\\textbf{Late and incomplete policy.} Late problem sets will be given partial credit. If you have an incomplete problem set, you \emph{must} submit the problems you did not solve. Students who do not answer all problems will be marked as incomplete.

\noindent\phantom{.}\\\textbf{Exams.} There will only be one two-hour final exam, held on session 12, as a mock qualifying stage.

\noindent\phantom{.}\\\textbf{Grading.} Weekly homework is 50\%, the final exam is 30\%, and in-class participation is 20\%.

\noindent\phantom{.}\\\textbf{Calendar.} There will be twelve sessions this year, followed by the PMO Qualifying Stage. Session 11 is after exams, for two hours; session 12 is for the whole day. Grades will be given out on session 12.

\subsubsection*{Reminders}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Some portion of your grade in Mathematics will be your grade in PRIME.} You are expected to work on homework in lieu of some of your activities in math class. In particular, \emph{you will have enough time for homework}. 

\item You can discuss homework with me or your classmates any time. If you get stuck on a problem, ask.

\item Remember to look at our Facebook group for updates!
