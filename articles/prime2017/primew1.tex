\subsubsection*{Homework}

Each person is assigned two sets based on their problem-solving level. For the first set assigned to you, you only need to submit your answers. For the second set, you must submit \emph{neat and orderly} solutions for each problem. Write your answers on short bond paper, write your name, and leave margins. 

Problems refer to VCSMS PRIME 2016, on \url{http://cjquines.com/files/prime.pdf}, which is also posted in our Facebook group. For example, ``\textbf{S9}: Circles 3--5, 7'' means problems 3, 4, 5 and 7 in the Circles section of PRIME 2016 session 9.

Due on Week 1 due date: Wednesday, September 20.

\subsubsection*{Additional problems}

These problems are optional. They range from easy to very hard.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $ABC$ is an isosceles triangle such that $AC = BC$. $CBD$ is an isosceles triangle such that $CB = DB$. $A$ and $D$ are on the same side of line $BC$, and segments $BD$ and $AC$ intersect at a right angle. If $\angle A = 57\dg$, what is $\angle D$?

  \item Quadrilateral $CFDE$ is inscribed in a circle with center $O$, which lies on segment $CD$. Lines $CE$ and $DF$ intersect at $A$ and lines $DE$ and $CF$ intersect at $B$. If $\angle EAD = 40\dg$ and minor arc $ED$ measures $40\dg$, find $m\angle DAB$.

  \item Two equilateral triangles $ABC$ and $ADE$ are drawn, both with side length $4$, such that segments $DE$ and $BC$ intersect and $AD$ and $BC$ are perpendicular. Find the area of the region common to both triangles.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\begin{minipage}{.70\textwidth}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[4.] Pentagon $ABCDE$ with side lengths $AB = BC = CD = 10, DE = 16, EA = 12$ is inscribed in a circle. If $\angle DEA = 90\dg$, find its area.

    \item[5.] (Mathira 2017) In the figure to the right, the nine circles all have radius $1$ and adjacent circles are either externally tangent or pass through each others' centers. Find the area of the shaded region.

    \item[6.] (AII2) Let $BH$ be the altitude from the vertex $B$ to the side $AC$ of an acute-angled triangle $ABC$. Let $D$ and $E$ be the midpoints of $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, and $F$ the reflection of $H$ across the line segment $ED$. Prove that the line $BF$ passes through the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$.
