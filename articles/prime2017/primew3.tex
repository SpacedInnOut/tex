\subsubsection*{Additional problems}

Again, the additional problems this week are \emph{required}. Set A has 1--3, set B has 4, set C has 5 and set D has 6.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Vincent is solving a problem: ``Two circles have radii $3$ and $27$, and the length of a common external tangent is $40$. What is the distance of their centers?'' However, he misread and thought it was ``common \emph{internal}'' tangent, and answered the problem correctly assuming this. What is the difference between Vincent's answer and the actual correct answer?

  \item (AIME 1994/2) A circle with diameter $PQ$ of length $10$ is internally tangent at $P$ to a circle of radius $20$. Square $ABCD$ is constructed with $A$ and $B$ on the larger circle, $CD$ tangent to $Q$ to the smaller circle, and the smaller circle outside $ABCD$. Find the length of $AB$.

  \item (AIME 1991/2) Rectangle $ABCD$ has $AB = 4$ and $CB = 3$. Divide $AB$ into $168$ congruent segments with points $A = P_0, P_1, \ldots, P_{168} = B$, and divide $CB$ into $168$ congruent segments with $C = Q_0, Q_1, \ldots, Q_{168} = B$. For $1 \leq k \leq 167$, draw the segments $P_kQ_k$. Repeat this construction on the sides $AD$ and $CD$, and then draw the diagonal $AC$. Find the sum of the lengths of the $335$ parallel segments drawn.

  \item (AHSME 1970) In trapezoid $ABCD$, we have $AB||CD$ and $\angle B = 2\angle D$. The length of $AB$ can be represented as $k$ times the length of $AD$ plus $\ell$ times the length of $CD$. What is $k + \ell$?

  \item (AIME 1998/6) Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram. Extend $DA$ through $A$ to a piont $P$, and let $PC$ meet $AB$ at $Q$ and $DB$ at $R$. Given that $PQ = 735$ and $QR = 112$, find $RC$.

  \item A quadrilateral circumscribed about a circle has two adjacent right angles. The sides adjacent to one right angle have lengths $4$ and $7$. Find the radius of the inscribed circle.
\end{enumerate}
