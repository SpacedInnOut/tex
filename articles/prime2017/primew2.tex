\subsubsection*{Additional problems}

Reminder: if you want more problems for practice I have some to give, just name a topic. This one includes some topics that haven't appeared in past PMOs but can appear in the future. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (AIME II 2004/4) How many positive integers less than 10,000 have at most two different digits?

  \item (OMO Winter 2012/2) How many ways are there to arrange the letters AAAHH so that the sequence HA appears at least once?

  \item (OMO Spring 2015/6) We delete the four corners of an $8\times 8$ chessboard. How many ways are there to place eight non-attacking rooks on the remaining squares?

  \item (AIME I 2001/6) A fair die is rolled four times. What is the probability each of the final three rolls is at least as large as the roll preceding it?

  \item (AIME I 2008/11) Consider sequences that consist entirely of $A$s and $B$s such that every run of consecutive $A$s has even length, and every run of consecutive $B$s has odd length. Examples are $AA$, $B$, and $AABAA$, while $BBAB$ is not such a sequence. How many such sequences have length $14$?

  \item (SASMO 2015) Cheryl gives Albert and Bernard a list of 10 possible dates for her birthday: May 15, 16, 19; June 17, 18; July 14, 16; and August 14, 15, 17. Cheryl tells Albert the month of her birthday, and tells Bernard the day of her birthday. Given the following conversation, when is Cheryl's birthday?

  Albert: ``I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that you don't know either.''

  Bernard: ``At first I didn't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but now I know.''

  Albert: ``Now I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.'' 

  \item (AMC 12A 2007/25) Call a set of integers \emph{spacy} if it contains no more than one out of any three consecutive integers. How many subsets of $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 12\}$, including the empty set, are spacy?

  \item (AIME 1986/13) How many different sequnces of $15$ coin tosses contain exactly two pairs of consecutive heads, three pairs of consecutive heads then tails, four pairs of consecutive tails then heads and five pairs of consecutive tails?

\end{enumerate}
