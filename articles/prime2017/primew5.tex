\subsubsection*{Additional problems}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The second-degree polynomial $P(x)$ satisfies $P(1) = 1, P(2) = 3, P(3) = 2$. Then $P(P(x)) = x$ has four real solutions, one of which is not an integer. Find the non-integral solution.
  \item Let $u > v$ be positive integers, $A(u, v)$, $B$ the reflection of $A$ about $y = x$, $C$ the reflection of $B$ about the $y$-axis, $D$ the reflection of $C$ about the $x$-axis, and $E$ the reflection of $D$ about the $y$-axis. If $[ABCDE]=451$, find $u+v$.
  \item (Resurgence) Complex $a, b, c$ satisfy $\abs{a} = \abs{b} = \abs{c} = 21$ and $ab + bc + ca = 0$. Determine $\abs{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$.
  \item Find the minimum magnitude of any $z$ satisfying $\abs{z-4i} + \abs{z - 3} = 5$.
  \item Suppose $x^{2017} = 1$ and $x \neq 1$. Evaluate $\dfrac1{1+x} + \dfrac1{1+x^2} + \cdots + \dfrac1{1+x^{2017}}$.
  \item Triangle $ABC$ has its circumcenter at the origin, its centroid at $(-1, 13)$ and the midpoint of side $BC$ at $(9, 18)$. Find the maximum possible product of the coordinates of $B$.
  \item (AIME 2005/14) Each of $(0, 12), (10, 9), (8, 0), (-4, 7)$ are on a different side of a square. Find its area.
  \item For how many positive integers less than $2017$ does $x^2 + x + 1$ divide $x^{2n} + 1 + (x + 1)^{2n}$?
  \item Let $f(x) = x^{2016} + 2x^{2015} + 3x^{2014} + \cdots + 2017$ and $z^{2018} = 1$ but $z \neq 1$. Find $f(z)f(z^2)\cdots f(z^{2017})$.
  \item (AIME 1992/10) Find the area of the region in the complex plane consisting of all points $z$ such that both $z/40$ and $40/\bar{z}$ have real and imaginary parts between 0 and 1 inclusive.
  \item Let $A(0, 0), B(b, 2)$ and $ABCDEF$ be a convex equilateral hexagon with $\angle FAB = 120\dg$, opposite sides parallel, and $y$-coordinates from $\cbr{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}$. Find its area.
  \item (AIME 1996/11) Let $P$ be the product of the roots of $z^6 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + 1 = 0$ that have a positive imaginary part. Find $\arg P$.
