This is the practice test, due on Friday, October 27, 2017.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The test follows the qualifying stage format, which means the time limit is two hours. These should be continuous; do not work for one hour on one day and then one hour on another day.
  \item No aids except scratch paper, ruler, and compass are permitted. No graph paper, protractors, calculators, computers, or mobile phones are allowed. Do not leave the testing area for the duration of the exam.
  \item Write your answers legibly on a clean sheet of short bond paper, with your name.
  \item Do not discuss the problems before Friday, October 27, when they are due.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Do not turn the page} until you have a timer for two hours and are ready to answer \textbf{without interruptions}.
