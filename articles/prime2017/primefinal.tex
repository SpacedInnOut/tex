Every power of two in a proper sum appears either once or twice. The following sums are \emph{not} proper: $$13 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 8 \qquad 10 = 2 + 4 + 4 \qquad 7 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2$$ Let $f(n)$ be the number of powers of two that appear twice in the proper sum of $n$. For example, $f(81) = 2$, since $2$ and $16$ appear twice. Find the $70$th smallest positive integer $n$ with $f(n) = 3$.
